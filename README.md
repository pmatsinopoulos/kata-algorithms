# Kata::Algorithms

A set of algorithm implementations in Ruby.

While reading the book [Algorithms in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059651624X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=059651624X&linkCode=as2&tag=panayotmatsin-20), we have
decided to implement a set of the algorithms presented there.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'algorithms'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install algorithms

## Usage

If you want to run a set of programs that use the algorithms
implemented, you can find them in the `bin` folder.

For example:

    bundle exec bin/addition

demonstrates the `Algorithms.addition` algorithm implementation.

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
